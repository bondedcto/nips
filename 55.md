A universal relative web-of-trust reputation protocol on Nostr. UniWoT.

Authors: @brainspacer, @distbit0

Overview

Reputation is multi-dimensional and sharding can be implemented to allow relays to handle specific dimensions of reputation, achieving load balancing and increased federation/censorship resistance. A more general reputation model can be used, denoted by Category, Dimension, and Scale. Each reputation rating is given in a single event, including the elements ratedID, raterID, category, dimension and scale (refer to the spec below for further details). This allows for a greater range of reputation use cases and increased adoption. Use cases include whitelisting and blacklisting and many more. Additionally, external reputation ratings can be recognised by Nostr, thereby enabling it to overcome any network effects of existing silos of reputation data. 

Clients may submit and query reputation events denoted by kind=9400 and that contain tags representing the reputation rating.

The reputation query mechanism relies on the existing NIP-12 Generic Tag Queries.

This NIP is a data type definition and does not require any change to relays.  

A reputation definition comprises a dimension, category, scale, rater, rated, comment and optionally an expiry date. Also, the elements informant, ratingProofType and externalRatingProof will allow external ratings to be recognised by Nostr (to be described in a future NIP).

   </td>
   <td>This holds the rated party’s ID.

Sometimes, this will be a Nostr pubkey and sometimes not.

<strong>Nostr-native ratings:</strong>
<p>
It will be a Nostr pubkey when the rated is a known Nostr pubkey. 
<p>
It will be a non-Nostr identifier where the rated party does not have a Nostr pubkey. E.g. when rating the Fed. :)
<p>
<strong>Imported external ratings:</strong>
<p>
It will be a non-Nostr identifier for imported external ratings.

   <td>Category
   </td>

<p>
For example, if someone is deemed a good “judge” of others in the field of, say, Austrian economics, that same good judgement may not apply in the field of, say, orchid gardening. Category allows for ratings to be filtered (by clients or relays) for more than one purpose and allows for applications to more flexibly share and reuse ratings.

Apps can decide the categories and dimensions they wish to use. There is no centrally-defined list of categories or dimensions. Other apps may adopt or query reputation events made by other apps if they are interesting to them. Clients may synthesise disparate reputations that will enable wholly new use cases to emerge. 

Regarding blacklist/whitelist registration. It is recognised that blacklist/whitelist detection and management is a complex issue and outside the scope of this NIP. The whitelist/blacklist tag is just to bring such lists in-protocol, allow sharding and enable efficient selective replication.

## 
**Suggested Use Cases**

Motivating examples for reputation events



* Allow an entity to rate other entities, thereby building a web of trust. Allow reputation ratings to be numerically scaled and to be positive or negative. 
* Allow an entity to determine a trust score for entities outside their web of trust.
* Allow multi-dimensional reputation to be established in any domain, including social media, ride sharing, business partnership ratings, employment/employer ratings, DeFi lending, decentralised ratings agencies. More generally, enables a flexible mechanism of reputation to emerge.  
* Social media app which automatically suggests content to a user using ratings automatically calculated from their existing web of trust ratings of other users
* Ride sharing app users to rate drivers and vice-versa.
* Marketplace platform to allow buyers and sellers to rate each other.
* Business partners to rate each others’ contract performance in various dimensions.
* Decentralised finance lending platforms to permit lenders to nominate and rate trusted users so as to extend favourable lending terms, thus introducing a new model of DeFi lending in addition to the currently capital-inefficient over collateralised lending model.
* Bounty platform clients and service providers to rate each other in various dimensions so as to provide extra heuristics of reputation when choosing partners and negotiating contract terms.
* Employment listing platforms to provide the extra heuristics of reputation of both employees and employers in various dimensions to allow better decision-making for both parties.
* DeFi insurance providers to use an extra heuristic of reputation in determining an insured party’s risk in calculating insurance premiums.
* Blacklist/whitelists: Any community (such as a Nostr client app, for example) or individual to register a user or an IP address on a specific blacklist or whitelist.
* Rating agency to rate entities. If one chooses to trust the rating agency, the rating agency’s ratings then appear in their WoT.  
* Attestations: allows an entity to declare a generalised attestation regarding another entity. e.g. effectively declare ‘Bob is the CTO of Swan Bitcoin,” via a proof provided by Swan Bitcoin.
* Allow an entity to issue an accreditation to another entity, with an optional time-limit.
* The above two examples largely intersect with the facility of soulbound tokens.
* And more.
* The motivating philosophy for this NIP is to better enable the decentralised economy via a flexible, extensible, relative web-of-trust reputation protocol, better manage spam and improve censorship resistance. This reputation model is conceptualised to enable organisations and individuals to establish and maintain their reputation as a valuable asset to facilitate interactions and seek favourable trading terms without involvement of third parties. This circumvents coercion by state actors, the censorship of the establishment financial system and dystopian WEF/UN ideals. A universal WoT reputation can be a key factor in enabling a global, pseudonymous economy. UniWoT.
